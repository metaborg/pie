/**
 * A session for incrementally executing PIE tasks. All methods are thread-safe and reentrant by locking.
 *
 * PIE supports two different traversal strategies:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Bottom-up (change-driven): given a set of changed resources, schedule all directly affected tasks in a topologically
 * sorted dependency queue, pop and execute tasks from the front of the queue until it is empty, where changed outputs
 * or provided resources of an executed task cause dependent affected tasks to be scheduled into the queue. Only tasks
 * that are {@link Observability#ExplicitObserved explicitly observed} or {@link Observability#ImplicitObserved
 * implicitly observed} are considered.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Top-down (scanning): given a root task to execute, check whether the task must be executed by checking its required
 * and provided resources, and by recursively checking required tasks, resulting in a top-down depth-first traversal of
 * the dependency graph. This can also mark the task as an {@link Observability#ExplicitObserved explicitly observed}
 * task, indicating that it, and its transitive dependencies, should be kept up-to-date in bottom-up builds.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * When executing a new task, or changing the input to a task, top-down execution must be used, as bottom-up execution
 * can only detect changes which originate from resources. When changes to resources are known, prefer bottom-up
 * execution, as it only traverses the affected part of the dependency graph, which is more efficient than top-down
 * execution which traverses the entire dependency graph rooted at a given task.
 *
 * When mixing a bottom-up build with top-down builds, a single {@link #updateAffectedBy bottom-up build} must be
 * executed first, which then returns a new session object of type {@link TopDownSession} which can be used to get task
 * outputs or to execute new tasks.
 *
 * Outputs of required tasks are observed by the observers {@link Pie#setCallback set} in the {@link Pie} object this
 * session was created from.
 *
 * When using a {@link CancelToken cancel checker}, execution is cancelled between task executions by throwing an {@link
 * InterruptedException}.
 *
 * @see Session for information on when a new session should be started.
